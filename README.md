# DataAnalytics

Dear visitor,

This folder contains several data-related projects I did the last year. Note that this folder is work in progress as I wrote all my scripts in Spyder and would like to covert them to Jupyter for visualisation and presentation purposes. 







These projects were fully volotarily and purely done because of my interest and curiosity. The knowledge required to complete these courses was gathered by means of several resources:

1. Recent TU Delft courses list item
2. Books such as
   - An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James
   - Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus
   - Data Science for Business What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking by Foster Provost
3. Courses provided by Udemy and Coursera

All required math and statistics was of course already present due to my background in aerospace engineering. Further, my first programming language is Python and was taught in my first year at TU Delft. I expended this by learning Matlab, R, and STATA. Besides, I have experience in object oriented languages (C++ and Fortran) due to my internships.
